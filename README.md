Sweave --> Rmd converter
===========

To do an initial conversion of vignettes of a package from Rnw to Rmd:

1. Click "Use this template" - "Create a new repository" above
2. Give the new repository the name of the Bioconductor package whose Rnw 
vignettes you would like to convert to Rmd
3. Wait for the GitHub Action of the new repository to finish
4. Check and edit the Rmd vignettes of the new repository until they work
5. Optional: activate GitHub Pages on the new repository; it will already have
pkgdown running in its GitHub Action.
